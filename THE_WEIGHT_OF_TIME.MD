The iron shackles clinked softly as Paul shifted his position on the stone floor of the Mamertine Prison. The dim light filtering through the narrow opening above cast dancing shadows on the damp walls, and the air hung heavy with the musty scent of confinement. Luke sat across from him, his physician’s hands carefully examining the raw wounds where the chains had chafed against Paul’s wrists.


“You’ve lost weight again,” Luke observed, his voice carrying the gentle authority of a healer. “The guards aren’t bringing you enough food.”

Paul managed a weary smile. “My dear Luke, you worry too much about this earthly vessel. It has served its purpose through beatings in Philippi, shipwrecks in the Mediterranean, and stones in Lystra. A little hunger in Rome seems almost… comfortable by comparison.”

Luke’s eyes darkened with concern as he dabbed a cloth against Paul’s wounds. “But this imprisonment is different, isn’t it? I can see it in your eyes, brother. There’s a weight there that wasn’t present even after your arrest in Jerusalem.”

The apostle’s gaze drifted to the small window above, where a sliver of Roman sky was visible. For a long moment, he remained silent, his weathered face reflecting an internal struggle that seemed to age him before Luke’s eyes.

“You know me too well, faithful physician,” Paul finally whispered. “Yes, this confinement has brought… challenges that the others did not. When I was younger, when I was Saul breathing threats against the disciples, action was everything. Movement, purpose, the next city to reach, the next synagogue to visit. But here…”

He gestured to the confining walls around them.

“Here, there is only time. Endless, crushing time. And with time comes memory, and with memory comes…”

“Depression?” Luke suggested gently.

Paul’s head snapped up, his eyes flashing with something between surprise and recognition. “You speak as a physician now.”

“I speak as your friend who has walked thousands of miles beside you, who has seen you face down Roman magistrates and Jewish authorities, who has watched you raise the dead and heal the sick. But I have never seen you struggle with the battles that rage within your own mind.”

Paul leaned back against the cold stone wall, his chains rattling softly. “Tell me, Luke, what do you know of the soul’s geography? Not the body’s — you know that better than any man — but the landscape of the heart when it is left alone with its thoughts?”

Luke set down his medical supplies and leaned forward, his scholarly mind engaging with the question. “I know that suffering can take many forms. Some are visible, like the scars on your back from the thirty-nine lashes. Others are hidden, like the wounds that time itself can inflict.”

“Precisely.” Paul’s voice dropped to barely above a whisper. “And I have discovered, in these months of captivity, that the mind is a dangerous country to explore without a map. Do you know what haunts me most in the darkness of this cell?”

“Tell me.”

Paul closed his eyes, and when he spoke, his voice carried the weight of decades. “Stephen. I see his face as clearly as I see yours now. The stones in my hands, the approval in my heart as the life left his eyes. The sound of his prayer — ‘Lord, do not hold this sin against them’ — echoing in my memory like thunder that never fades.”

Luke remained silent, sensing that Paul needed to release words that had been damming up inside him.

“And not just Stephen,” Paul continued, his voice growing stronger with each confession. “Every believer I pursued. Every home I invaded. Every family I tore apart in my zeal for what I thought was righteousness. Their faces come to me here, Luke. In the silence, they come like visitors I cannot turn away.”

“Paul — “

“No, let me finish.” The apostle’s eyes opened, and they blazed with an intensity that made Luke draw back slightly. “This is what I have learned in this prison: when the body is chained, the mind becomes a wanderer. And where does it wander? To the past, always to the past. To regrets that gnaw like rats in the walls, to shame that presses down like these very stones above us.”

Luke leaned forward, his physician’s instincts fully engaged. “You speak of depression as though it were a place.”

“Is it not?” Paul challenged. “Tell me, when you have seen patients consumed by melancholy, where do their thoughts reside? Are they present with you in your examination room, or are they somewhere else entirely?”

Luke considered this carefully. “You’re right. They are… elsewhere. Living in moments that have already passed, unable to escape the gravity of their regrets.”

“Exactly.” Paul’s voice carried a note of triumph, as if he had just solved a complex theological puzzle. “Depression, I have discovered, is not merely an emotion. It is a residence. It is taking up permanent dwelling in the country of the past, building a house there, and refusing to leave even when the present offers freedom.”

The sound of footsteps echoed from the corridor above, and both men fell silent until the Roman guards passed. When the quiet returned, Luke spoke softly.

“But you have not remained in that country, Paul. I can see it in your eyes even now. You have found a way out.”

Paul’s smile was sad but genuine. “With God’s help, yes. But not before I learned another truth about the mind’s geography. Would you hear it?”

“Of course.”

“The future is as dangerous a destination as the past, perhaps more so. When I first arrived in this prison, after the initial wave of regret subsided, do you know where my thoughts turned?”

Luke shook his head.

“To tomorrow. To next week, next month, next year. To all the churches I would never visit again, all the letters I would never write, all the souls I would never reach. I became consumed with visions of a future where the gospel died with me in this cell, where the work of decades crumbled because I was not there to sustain it.”

Paul’s voice grew agitated as he continued. “I saw the Galatians returning to legalism without my guidance. I imagined the Corinthians tearing themselves apart with their divisions. I pictured the Ephesians forgetting the mystery of Christ that I had revealed to them. Night after night, I lived through disasters that had not occurred, tragedies that existed only in my fearful imagination.”

Luke nodded slowly. “Anxiety. You’re describing anxiety.”

“Yes, but again, you speak as though it were merely a feeling. It is more than that, Luke. Anxiety is citizenship in a country that does not yet exist. It is building a life in tomorrow while today wastes away unused.”

The physician rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “I have seen this in patients as well. Those who cannot eat because they are consumed with worries about what might happen. Who cannot sleep because they are already living through crises that may never come to pass.”

“Precisely. And I became such a man, Luke. Can you imagine it? Paul the apostle, who had faced lions and serpents, who had been caught up to the third heaven, who had seen the risen Christ himself — reduced to a trembling prisoner, not by Roman chains, but by fears of futures that existed only in his own mind.”

Paul’s voice broke slightly, and Luke reached out to place a comforting hand on his shoulder.

“How did you escape?” Luke asked gently.

Paul was quiet for a long moment, gathering his thoughts. When he spoke again, his voice carried a different quality — not the pain of confession, but the wonder of discovery.

“It began with a dream, or perhaps a vision — I cannot say which. I saw myself standing in a vast landscape, with two roads stretching away from me. One led backward, winding through valleys filled with shadows and the echoes of old voices. The other led forward, up mountains shrouded in mist, where I could see the shapes of fears and anxieties waiting like bandits.”

“And you chose neither road?”

“I chose neither road.” Paul’s voice grew stronger. “Instead, I sat down right where I was. And as I sat, I began to notice things I had never seen before. The feeling of breath moving in and out of my lungs. The sound of my own heartbeat. The way the light changed as it moved across the walls of this cell throughout the day.”

Luke’s eyes widened with understanding. “You chose the present.”

“I chose the present,” Paul confirmed. “And Luke, it was like discovering a country I had never known existed, though I had been standing on its borders my entire life. The present is not a place of regret or fear — it is a place of… what is the word?”

“Peace?”

“Peace, yes, but more than that. Presence. The presence of God, who is not confined to our memories of yesterday or our anxieties about tomorrow, but who exists in the eternal now. The great I AM, not I WAS or I WILL BE, but I AM.”

Paul’s eyes began to shine with an inner light that seemed to push back the gloom of the prison cell.

“Tell me more,” Luke urged. “How does one learn to live in this present country?”

Paul shifted his position, his chains clanking softly. “It requires the discipline of attention, my friend. Do you know what I have been doing these past weeks? I have been learning to pray differently.”

“How so?”

“Before, my prayers were either confessions about the past or petitions about the future. ‘Forgive me for what I did to Stephen.’ ‘Protect the church in Corinth from division.’ But now I pray the prayer of presence: ‘Thank you for this breath. Show me your face at this moment. What would you have me do right now, in this cell, with these chains, in this hour?’”

Luke leaned back, his mind racing with the implications. “And what has God shown you?”

Paul’s laugh was rich and full, completely incongruous with their surroundings. “He has shown me that this prison is not a prison at all, but a classroom. That these chains are not bonds, but tools for learning. That this forced stillness is not punishment, but preparation.”

“Preparation for what?”

“For the lesson I needed most to learn: that the kingdom of God is not behind us in what we have accomplished, nor ahead of us in what we hope to achieve, but within us, right now, in this very moment.”

Paul’s voice grew passionate as he continued. “Luke, I have preached to thousands about the mystery of Christ in you, the hope of glory. But I never truly understood it until I was stripped of past achievements and future plans and left with only the naked present. And in that nakedness, I found Him more fully than I ever had before.”

Luke sat in stunned silence for a moment, processing the depth of his friend’s transformation. “This is why your recent letters have been different. I noticed it in the letter to the Philippians — there was a joy in it that seemed almost supernatural given your circumstances.”

“Because I was no longer writing from the country of regret or the territory of anxiety. I was writing from the land of the present, where ‘to live is Christ and to die is gain’ is not a theological statement but a lived reality.”

“But Paul,” Luke said carefully, “surely we are meant to learn from the past? And surely wisdom requires us to plan for the future?”

Paul nodded eagerly. “Of course! But there is a difference between visiting those countries and taking up residence there. The past is a teacher, not a home. The future is a direction, not a destination. But the present — the present is where we live, where we love, where we serve, where we encounter the living God.”

The afternoon light was beginning to fade, and the shadows in the cell grew longer. Luke lit a small oil lamp, its warm glow creating an intimate circle of light around the two men.

“I want to understand this more deeply,” Luke said. “Can you tell me about specific moments when you learned to choose the present over the past or future?”

Paul’s eyes grew distant as he remembered. “There was a night, perhaps two months ago, when the weight of my regrets about persecuting the church became almost unbearable. I was reliving the scene where I held the coats of those who stoned Stephen, feeling every detail as if it were happening again. The heat of that day, the sound of the stones striking flesh, the look of peace on Stephen’s face even as he died.”

Luke winced, imagining the torment such memories could bring.

“I was drowning in it, Luke. The shame was like water filling my lungs. But then I heard something — a sound so simple I almost missed it. A drop of water, falling from the ceiling of this cell to the floor. Just one drop, then another, then another.”

Paul’s voice grew quiet with wonder. “And I realized that each drop was happening now, in the present moment. Not in the past with Stephen, not in some imagined future, but right here, right now. So I began to count them. One… two… three… And with each drop, I felt myself being pulled back from the past into the present.”

“And the guilt? The regret?”

“Still there, but transformed. No longer a crushing weight from the past, but information available in the present. The knowledge of what I had done became wisdom for what I could do now. I could not change my persecution of Stephen, but I could write a letter to Timothy encouraging him in his ministry. I could not undo the harm I had caused to families, but I could pray for them right now, at this moment.”

Luke nodded slowly. “The past became a resource rather than a prison.”

“Exactly. And the same principle applies to anxiety about the future. There was another night when I became consumed with worry about what would happen to the gospel after my death. I saw in my mind’s eye the churches falling away, the message becoming corrupted, the work of decades undone.”

Paul’s voice quickened with the memory of his panic. “I was living through the collapse of everything I had built, experiencing the grief of failures that had not yet occurred and might never occur. My heart was racing, my breathing shallow. I was dying a thousand deaths of imagination.”

“How did you return to the present that time?”

“Through my body,” Paul said with a smile. “I placed my hand on my chest and felt my heartbeat. Steady, strong, alive. I felt the air entering my lungs, cool and fresh. I felt the rough texture of the stone wall against my back. My body was telling me the truth: I was alive, I was here, I was now. The future catastrophes existed only in my mind.”

Paul leaned forward, his eyes intense. “And then I asked myself: what can I do right now, in this moment, for the kingdom of God? Not tomorrow, not next year, but right now. And the answer came immediately: I could pray. I could write. I could love you, my friend, who was sitting right here with me.”

“So you chose action in the present over anxiety about the future.”

“Yes, but more than that. I chose trust. Trust that the God who had sustained the gospel through my persecution of it, who had used even my imprisonment to spread the word to the Praetorian Guard, who had taken my weakness and made it strength — this same God could be trusted with the future of His church.”

Luke was quiet for a moment, then asked, “But what about hope? Surely we are called to hope in future promises?”

Paul’s face lit up. “Ah, but you see, hope is not anxiety! Hope is not living in the future — hope is bringing the future into the present. When I hope for the resurrection, I am not escaping to some distant tomorrow. I am experiencing the power of resurrection life right now, in this cell, in these chains.”

“I’m not sure I follow.”

“Listen carefully, dear friend. Anxiety about the future is fear-based. It imagines disasters and lives in them. But hope is faith-based. It trusts in God’s promises and draws strength from them for present action. When I hope for the resurrection, I am not waiting passively for some future event. I am living now with the confidence that death has no power over me, which transforms how I face each present moment.”

Paul’s voice grew passionate. “The difference is this: anxiety about the future makes me paralyzed in the present. But hope in the future makes me bold in the present. One is slavery, the other is freedom.”

The oil lamp flickered, casting dancing shadows on the walls. Luke added more oil and adjusted the wick, his movements careful and deliberate.

“You speak of these insights as if they were revelations,” Luke observed. “But surely you knew these truths before your imprisonment?”

Paul laughed ruefully. “Knowing and living are different countries, my friend. I knew many things about God before I learned to meet Him in the present moment. I knew about His forgiveness, but I lived in the guilt of the past. I knew about His sovereignty, but I lived in anxiety about the future. I knew about His presence, but I lived everywhere except where He actually was — in the now.”

“What changed?”

“Desperation,” Paul said simply. “When you are stripped of everything else — your freedom, your ministry, your plans, your ability to control anything — you are left with only the present moment. And in that forced simplicity, you discover what was always there but had been crowded out by the noise of yesterday and tomorrow.”

Paul shifted position again, his chains ringing softly in the quiet cell. “Luke, I want to tell you about the morning I truly understood what it means to live in the present. It was about six weeks ago, just after dawn. I was watching the light creep down the wall of this cell, and I began to see it not as illumination coming to dispel darkness, but as a gift being offered moment by moment.”

“How so?”

“Each ray of light existed only in the instant it appeared. It was not the same light that had been there the moment before, nor was it the light that would be there the moment after. It was entirely and completely present, holding nothing back, giving everything it had to that single moment.”

Paul’s voice grew soft with wonder. “And I realized that this is how God gives Himself to us. Not as a reservoir of past blessings to be remembered, not as a promise of future grace to be anticipated, but as present love being poured out moment by moment, breath by breath, heartbeat by heartbeat.”

Luke found himself leaning forward, captivated by the intensity of Paul’s revelation.

“I began to pray differently that morning,” Paul continued. “Instead of asking God for things I wanted in the future or forgiveness for things I had done in the past, I began to ask Him to help me receive fully what He was giving me right now. And Luke, what He was giving me was Himself. Not a memory of Himself, not a promise of Himself, but His actual presence, available completely in that moment.”

“And you found peace.”

“I found more than peace. I found the source of peace. Peace is not the absence of conflict, Luke. There is plenty of conflict in this prison — the guards are harsh, the food is poor, the conditions are miserable. Peace is the presence of God in the midst of whatever circumstances exist right now.”

Paul’s eyes shone with conviction. “This is what I had been missing all these years of ministry. I had been so focused on taking the gospel to every corner of the empire that I had forgotten to let the gospel take root in the corner of my own heart called ‘this moment.’”

Luke rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “But surely your evangelistic work was important. You brought the message of Christ to countless souls.”

“Of course it was important! But I did much of it from the wrong place. I was often preaching from my anxiety about the future — driven by fear that people would die without hearing the gospel — rather than from the peace of the present, where God’s love is already complete and perfect.”

Paul’s voice grew reflective. “Do you know what I have discovered? When I minister from the present moment, from the place of God’s peace, the message carries more power. When I wrote the letter to the Philippians from this place of presence, every word came from rest rather than striving. And I believe it will have more impact than many of the letters I wrote from places of urgency and anxiety.”

“Because you were writing from peace rather than from pressure.”

“Exactly. And the recipients will feel that difference. They will sense that these words come from someone who has found what they are looking for, rather than from someone who is still searching.”

The evening air was growing cooler, and Luke pulled his cloak more tightly around his shoulders. “Paul, I want to ask you something that may sound foolish.”

“Ask anything, dear friend.”

“If living in the present brings such peace, why do we so naturally drift toward the past and future? Why is it so difficult to stay in the now?”

Paul smiled at the question. “Not foolish at all. In fact, it goes to the heart of our fallen nature. Think about it, Luke. Where do we go to hide from God? Where did Adam and Eve try to conceal themselves after they sinned?”

Luke thought for a moment. “They… they hid among the trees. They tried to escape His presence.”

“And where is God’s presence most available to us?”

“In the present moment.”

“So where do we hide when we want to avoid dealing with God? We escape into the past, where we can nurse our wounds and justify our grudges. Or we flee to the future, where we can worry about problems that may never exist. Both are ways of avoiding the immediate encounter with the living God who meets us in the now.”

Paul’s voice grew intense. “The present moment is dangerous to our flesh, Luke, because it is where God’s love is most immediate, where His truth is most clear, where His call is most direct. In the present, we cannot hide behind yesterday’s accomplishments or tomorrow’s plans. We must face who we are right now, and more importantly, who He is right now.”

“So learning to live in the present is a form of repentance.”

“Precisely. It is turning away from the false refuges of past and future and turning toward the God who says, ‘I AM.’ It is a daily choice to stop running and start receiving.”

Luke stood and walked to the small window, looking up at the stars that were beginning to appear in the darkening sky. “I think I understand now why your imprisonment has been so transformative. You’ve been forced to practice the presence of God in a way that your busy ministry never allowed.”

“Yes, but Luke, this is not a lesson for prisoners alone. Every believer needs to learn this discipline. In fact, I would say that learning to live in the present moment is one of the most important spiritual practices a Christian can develop.”

“How so?”

Paul struggled to his feet, his chains making the movement awkward. “Because this is where faith actually lives. Not in memories of past victories or hopes for future deliverance, but in present trust. Right now, at this moment, do I believe that God is good? Right now, in this cell, do I trust that He is working all things together for good? Right now, with these chains, do I choose to rejoice in Him?”

Paul’s voice grew stronger as he spoke. “Faith is not a past decision or a future hope — it is a present choice, made moment by moment, breath by breath. And the same is true for love, for joy, for peace, for all the fruits of the Spirit. They exist in the present tense or they do not exist at all.”

Luke turned back from the window, his face illuminated by the lamplight. “You’re saying that the Christian life is not about getting ready to live, but about actually living.”

“Exactly! How many believers spend their entire lives preparing for some future spiritual experience while missing the spiritual reality that is available right now? They are waiting for a dramatic encounter with God while He is speaking to them in the ordinary moments of this very day.”

Paul moved closer to the light, his shadow dancing on the wall behind him. “Luke, I have had visions of heaven, I have been caught up in ecstasy, I have seen miracles that defy description. But I tell you the truth: none of those extraordinary experiences brought me closer to God than learning to find Him in the simple present moment of a conversation with a friend in a Roman prison.”

“Because in the present moment, there are no distractions.”

“Because in the present moment, there is no pretense. I cannot impress God with my past accomplishments or promise Him future dedication. I can only be who I am right now, and receive who He is right now. And that encounter — stripped of all performance and pretense — is the purest form of worship.”

Luke sat back down, his mind working through the implications of what Paul was saying. “This changes everything about how I understand spiritual disciplines. Prayer, reading scripture, fellowship — all of it.”

“Tell me what you mean.”

“Well, I used to think of prayer as a way to influence God about future events or to process past failures. But if what you’re saying is true, prayer is really about connecting with God’s presence right now.”

Paul nodded eagerly. “Yes! Prayer is not a technique for getting God to do what we want. It is a practice of becoming present to what God is already doing. When I pray now, I am not trying to change God’s mind about the future. I am opening my heart to His love in the present.”

“And scripture?”

“Scripture is not a book about God — it is a meeting place with God. When I read David’s psalms now, I am not learning about how David felt long ago. I am encountering the same God who met David, and who is meeting me right now in this cell.”

Paul’s excitement was growing. “Do you see how this transforms everything? Fellowship is not just social interaction — it is the recognition of Christ’s presence in the person sitting across from me. Communion is not a memorial of past events — it is a present encounter with the living Christ. Worship is not preparation for heaven — it is heaven breaking into this moment.”

Luke shook his head in wonder. “No wonder you seemed different when I arrived today. You’re not the same man I left here three months ago.”

“I am more myself than I have ever been,” Paul replied. “When you stop running from the present moment, you discover who you really are. Not who you were in the past, not who you hope to become in the future, but who you are right now in God’s sight.”

The sound of footsteps echoed in the corridor again, and both men could hear the guards making their evening rounds. Luke glanced toward the sound, then back at Paul.

“What happens now?” Luke asked quietly. “You may face execution soon. How does this teaching about living in the present apply when the future holds such uncertainty?”

Paul’s face grew solemn, but there was no fear in his eyes. “Luke, if I am executed tomorrow, I will meet death as a man who has learned to live. Every moment between now and then is a gift to be received fully. If I am released, I will continue my ministry from this place of presence rather than from anxiety about results.”

“You’re not afraid?”

“I am at peace. Not because I know what will happen, but because I know who holds what will happen. And I know that He holds it not in some distant future, but right here, right now, in this very moment.”

Paul sat back down, moving carefully because of his chains. “Luke, I want to tell you the most important thing I have learned in this prison. Are you listening carefully?”

“Yes.”

“The kingdom of God is not a place we go to when we die. It is not a future reward for present faithfulness. The kingdom of God is available right now, in this moment, to anyone who chooses to receive it. It is the rule and reign of God’s love in the present tense of our lives.”

Paul’s voice grew passionate. “When Jesus said the kingdom of heaven is at hand, He did not mean it was coming soon. He meant it was within reach right now. When He taught us to pray ‘Thy kingdom come,’ He was not asking for a future event — He was asking for a present reality.”

“So salvation is not just about going to heaven when we die.”

“Salvation is about coming alive while we live! It is about being rescued from the prisons of past and future and brought into the freedom of the present, where God’s love is always available, always sufficient, always enough.”

Luke leaned forward, his voice urgent. “Paul, you must write these things down. These insights must not be lost.”

Paul smiled. “I am writing them down, dear friend. Not on parchment, but on the tablets of lived experience. Not in letters to churches, but in the transformation of a life. The most powerful testimony I can give is not words about these truths, but a life lived from these truths.”

“But others need to hear this message.”

“They will hear it, Luke. Not because I preach it, but because they see it. When a man learns to live in the present moment with God, others sense the difference. There is a peace that cannot be explained, a joy that does not depend on circumstances, a love that is not diminished by difficulty.”

Paul’s eyes shone with conviction. “The guards in this prison have noticed the change in me. They ask why I am not bitter, why I do not complain, why I seem content despite my circumstances. I do not give them theological lectures. I simply live from the present moment, and they see the reality of God’s kingdom in action.”

The night was growing late, and Luke knew he would need to leave soon. But he was reluctant to end this conversation that had opened up new worlds of understanding.

“One more question,” Luke said. “How can I learn to live this way? I want to experience what you have found, but I am not in prison. I have the distractions of normal life, the demands of my medical practice, the pull of responsibilities.”

Paul’s laugh was warm and knowing. “My dear Luke, you think that prison walls are what forced me into the present moment. But the real prison walls were in my mind — the walls of regret about the past and anxiety about the future. You carry the same prison with you wherever you go.”

“So how do I escape?”

“The same way I did. By recognizing that the present moment is always available, regardless of your circumstances. Whether you are in a Roman prison or a Greek marketplace, whether you are treating patients or writing letters, this moment is where God meets you.”

Paul leaned forward, his voice intense with urgency. “Start small, Luke. When you are with a patient, be fully present with that patient. Do not let your mind wander to the next appointment or linger on the previous case. Give yourself completely to this person, this moment, this opportunity to serve.”

“And when I am alone?”

“Practice gratitude for what is, rather than longing for what was or anxiety about what might be. When you eat, taste your food completely. When you walk, feel each step. When you breathe, notice the miracle of air filling your lungs. These simple acts of attention are prayers of presence.”

Paul’s voice grew gentle. “And when you fail — when you catch your mind drifting to past regrets or future fears — do not condemn yourself. Simply notice where you have gone, and gently return to the present. It is practice, not perfection.”

Luke nodded slowly. “It sounds so simple.”

“It is simple, but not easy. It requires the courage to stop running from God and the discipline to keep returning to His presence. But Luke, I promise you this: if you learn to live in the present moment, you will discover treasures that no Roman emperor could afford to buy.”

“What kind of treasures?”

“The treasure of peace that does not depend on circumstances. The treasure of joy that is not diminished by difficulty. The treasure of love that is not exhausted by giving. The treasure of knowing God not as a distant deity, but as a present friend.”

Paul’s voice grew quiet with wonder. “And the greatest treasure of all: the discovery that you are completely loved, completely accepted, completely enough, right now, in this moment, exactly as you are.”

Luke felt tears welling up in his eyes. “Paul, I think I have been living my entire life in preparation for living. Always getting ready for the next thing, the next opportunity, the next spiritual experience.”

“And what have you discovered?”

“That I have been missing the life that was available to me all along.”

Paul reached out and gripped Luke’s hand, his chains clanking softly. “Then you understand, my friend. You understand the tragedy of the human condition: we are surrounded by the presence of God, but we live as if He were absent. We are immersed in His love, but we live as if we were orphaned. We are citizens of His kingdom, but we live as if we were refugees.”

“But no more.”

“But no more. From this day forward, you can choose to live in the present moment, where God’s love is always available, always sufficient, always enough. Will you make that choice?”

Luke squeezed Paul’s hand in return. “I will. God help me, I will.”

The two men sat in comfortable silence for a few moments, the weight of the conversation settling into their hearts. Finally, Luke spoke.

“Paul, I need to go. But before I leave, will you pray with me?”

“Of course.”

Paul closed his eyes and spoke softly. “Father, we thank You for this conversation, for this moment, for this friendship. We thank You that Your presence is not confined to synagogues or temples, but is available here in this prison, in this cell, in this very instant.”

His voice grew stronger. “Help Luke to discover the treasures that await him in the present moment. Help him to find You not in the past or the future, but in the now. And help both of us to live each remaining day of our lives from this place of presence, this place of peace, this place of Your perfect love.”

“Amen,” Luke whispered.

As Luke gathered his medical supplies and prepared to leave, Paul spoke one final time.

“Luke, when you write about these things someday — and I believe you will — remember this: the good news is not just that Jesus died for our sins and rose again. The good news is that He is alive right now, available right now, present right now to anyone who will receive Him in the present moment.”

Luke paused at the entrance to the cell. “I will remember, Paul. And I will live it.”

As the sound of Luke’s footsteps faded in the corridor, Paul settled back against the stone wall, his chains resting quietly around him. The oil lamp flickered gently, casting a warm circle of light in the darkness.

He closed his eyes and felt his breath moving in and out, felt his heart beating steadily in his chest, felt the presence of the God who had met him in this unlikely classroom. For the first time in his life, Paul the apostle was completely present, completely at peace, completely home.

In the distance, he could hear the sounds of Rome — the clatter of carts on cobblestones, the voices of merchants closing their shops, the laughter of children playing in the streets. But here in this cell, in this moment, in this breath, there was only the profound silence of a soul that had finally learned to be still and know that God is God.

And in that stillness, Paul smiled, understanding at last that he had found the treasure he had been searching for all his life. Not in the past achievements of his ministry, not in the future hopes of his reward, but in the simple, sacred present moment where God’s love was being poured out like light, like breath.
